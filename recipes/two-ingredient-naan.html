        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>While not a true naan bread, this sure works in a pinch!</p>
            <p>It's easier than you think to make homemade naan. With this shortcut recipe, you need just a couple ingredients you may already have on hand. Learn how to make and use two-ingredient naan today.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Self-rising flour: You'll need 1 Â¼ cups of self-rising flour. If you only have all-purpose flour on hand, you can make a DIY version with just a few ingredients.</li>
                <li>Yogurt: Plain Greek yogurt holds the naan dough together and ensures a tender texture. Make sure you get authentic Greek yogurt and not Greek-style yogurt.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix Ingredients: Mix the flour and yogurt until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
                <li>Knead: Transfer to a flour-dusted work surface, then knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Add more flour as needed if the dough becomes too sticky.</li>
                <li>Shape: Pat the dough into a rectangle. Divide into eight equal portions, lightly flatten, and shape into a semi-rectangular shape.</li>
                <li>Cook: Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat. Add one or two pieces of dough and cook until they begin to bubble and brown. Flip and continue cooking until both sides are cooked.</li>
            </ol>
